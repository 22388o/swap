Cryptocurrencies were created to make it possible for advanced, encrypted payments to be made between two
or more people digitally, without the parties involved having to trust each other for the payment be
completed. In other words, cryptocurrencies make it possible to send money reliably to other people over
the internet without the money being double spent, and without people getting scammed out of their money
when they try to make these digital payments.

.. note::
    Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs) are a perfect example of a payment technology for cryptocurrencies which
    makes all of the aforementioned things possible.

Swap is a python library for cross-chain atomic swap between the networks of two cryptocurrencies.
Cross-chain atomic swap are the cheapest and most secure way to swap cryptocurrencies. Itâ€™s a brand new
decentralized payment environment based on Hash Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs) protocol.
